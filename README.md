## ->) Binary Classification Web App :-

The Streamlit-based web application specializes in the binary classification of mushrooms, allowing users to distinguish between edible and poisonous varieties based on diverse features. The tool seamlessly integrates three well-known classification algorithmsâ€”Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Users can effortlessly navigate the interface, selecting their preferred classifier, adjusting hyperparameters via the sidebar, and visually assessing model performance metrics. Notably, the inclusion of dynamic plots, including the Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Curve, enhances the interpretability of results.

Under the hood, the application optimizes efficiency through caching mechanisms, ensuring swift loading and splitting of the dataset. The real-time display of classification results, featuring accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of each model's effectiveness. Overall, the web app provides an accessible and interactive platform, accommodating users of varying expertise levels to explore and compare different classification models on the mushroom dataset, shedding light on the nuances of mushroom characteristics and classification performance.
